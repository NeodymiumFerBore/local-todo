# Local TODO

A todo list webapp that does not store your data on any kind of server. All data is saved in browser's local storage.

In the future, optional sync settings may be implemented to store (and share) user data in places like
Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc. Choose a place you trust, and not yet another third party.
